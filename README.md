# Introduction

March—the month of madness, the month of elite college basketball. It's the time when college students rally behind their schools, hoping for a chance to make it to the championship final. But out of the 64 teams that qualify for the tournament, only one will emerge as the champion. The heartbreak and frustration felt by the other 63 teams are palpable.

The **2024 March Madness** was my initiation into the world of collegiate basketball, and it did not disappoint. From Cinderella stories to 16-seed upsets and back-to-back dominations, the tournament buzzed with excitement. As I crafted my predictions at the tournament's outset—relying on basic stats, input from friends, and a dash of chance—I realized that my choices were far from concrete.

As the tournament unfolded, I witnessed brackets crumbling left and right. It wasn't until the **Oakland vs. University of Kentucky** matchup that my own bracket met its demise. Oakland, an underdog not on my radar, pulled off an unexpected victory. Despite my limited knowledge of collegiate basketball, I felt comfortable with my selections. However, reality soon set in: Teams that defied popular expectations continued to win, and by the end of the first round, only a mere **0.005% of perfect brackets** remained, as reported by ESPN News. Thus began my interest in predicting a team’s performance within the tournament using a Machine Learning Approach. 


# AP Polls

My initial focus was on understanding how a team’s regular-season performance correlates with their tournament performance. To explore this, I decided to visualize the performance of selected number 1 seeds and gain insights into their seeding, based on the AP Polls.

The trends seem to be subutle, nothing to drastic. Majority of the teams seem to have the right for their placement, as their perfromance were known to be within the top 5. The more I tried to understand the data, I had to also compare the number one ranked team, Alabama with the championship finalists.

When comparing the performances of the teams that reached the championship game, it's notable that their scores exhibited less consistency throughout the season compared to Alabama. However, these teams showed improvement from their initial Pre scores to their final scores, indicating progression in their performance over time. UConn, the winners of the 2023 March Madness, had a very interesting performance, fluctuating throughout the season. This is important because relying solely on the AP Polls may not be a strong indicator of how these teams perform in the postseason.

While the answer to this question is highly anticipated, it's important to note that AP Polls serve as a supportive metric in classifying seeds for the March Madness bracket. Therefore,there is more than just what the AP Polls tell us. Therfore, If we understand seeding placements, it would help us understand how teams can perform during the March Madness tournament.


# Seeding Prediction 

A recent video essay I watched, titled ‘The NCAA Tournament Is a Loser Machine’ by the YouTuber Secret Base, presented several compelling arguments. To begin with, the essay highlighted that ‘your seed does not determine how easy your road through the tournament will be.’ This caught my attention because most basketball playoffs follow a seeding-style tournament, where lower-seeded teams face higher-seeded opponents. Consequently, I decided to explore whether machine learning (ML) could predict a team’s seeding placement based on their season performances.
